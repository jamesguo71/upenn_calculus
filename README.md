This repository is my personal notes of the Coursera MOOC [_Calculus: Single Variable Part 1 - Functions_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-variable-calculus).

Notes are written in Jupyter Notebooks with SymPy, LaTeX and some Python scripts.

These are my personal notes so probably won't work for you for the purpose of learning calculus. But if you spot any error please feel free to make an issue or a pull request.
