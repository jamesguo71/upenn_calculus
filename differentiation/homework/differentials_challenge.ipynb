    "The *stopping distance* $D_{stop}$ is the distance traveled by a vehicle from the moment the driver becomes aware of an obstacle in the road until the car stops completely. This occurs in two phases.\n",

This entails taking the decision to stop the vehicle, lifting the foot from the gas pedal and onto the brake pedal, and pressing the latter down its full distance to obtain maximum braking power. The amount of time necessary to do all this is called the reaction time $t_{react}$, and is independent of the speed at which the vehicle was traveling. Although this quantity varies from driver to driver, it is typically between $1.5 s$ and $2.5 s$. For the purposes of this problem, we will use an average value of $2 s$.
