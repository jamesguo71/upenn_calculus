    "In this problem we will study a very basic traffic model. Consider a stretch of highway in which cars are traveling at an average speed $v$. The *traffic density* $u$ is the total amount of cars on our stretch of road divided by its length. These two quantities are related: the less cars on the road, the faster drivers are able to go. On the other hand, if traffic becomes heavy, drivers will naturally decrease their speed. The so-called *parabolic model* assumes that this relationship is dictated by the equation $$\n",
    "u = u_{max} (1 - \\frac{v}{v_{max}})\n",
    "$$ where $v_{max}$ represents the capacity of the road, and $v_{max}$ the speed limit on it.\n",
